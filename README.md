# Research Method
The picture day1, day2 and day3 are by daily sketches. 
On day1, you will find the understand phase. Throughout the project I consider myself as a freelancer who was asked to solve the problem of the product owner who is the director. Therefore I will work with the school team to look for a solution.
On day2, I sketched ideas from the team and finally on day3, I pick the ideas to apply and the ones to save for later.
