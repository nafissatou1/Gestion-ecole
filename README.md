# Research Method
The picture day1, day2 and day3 are by daily sketches. Download pictures for a better user.
On day1, you will find the understand phase. Throughout the project I consider myself as a freelancer who was asked to solve the problem of the product owner who is the director. Therefore I will work with the school team to look for a solution.
On day2, I sketched ideas from the team and finally on day3, I pick the ideas to apply and the ones to save for later.

# Prototype
You can find my prototype on the following link:

You dont have to put any login details just click on login button to access the page.
Every person using the app will have special modules they can acces to. That's why we have the user option on the login page.We tried to keep things as simple as possible for the Director.
Once logged in, you can navigate through the menu links only.
